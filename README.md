# JavaScript Core Fundamentals & Algorithms

A collection of optimized solutions and mini-projects demonstrating core JavaScript logic, Data Structures, and Algorithms (DSA). 

## 🚀 Purpose
This repository documents my deep dive into the intricacies of JavaScript. Rather than just syntax, this collection focuses on **functional programming patterns**, **algorithm efficiency**, and **modern ES6+ standards**.

It serves as a codebase for verifying foundational concepts before scaling up to framework-based development (React/Vue).

## 📂 Key Implementations

### 1. Algorithm Scripting
Solved complex mathematical and string manipulation challenges using efficient logic.
- **Range-Based LCM:** computed using Euclidean algorithms (GCD) and `reduce()`.
- **Prime Sum Generator:** Optimized loop logic for efficient summation.

### 2. Data Structures & Recursion
- **Deep Flattener:** Custom recursive engine to handle nested arrays of any depth (replacing `.flat()`).
- **Symmetric Difference:** Set theory implementation to compare unique dataset values.
- **Seek & Destroy:** Advanced filtering using the `arguments` object.

### 3. Functional Programming
- **Object Query Engine:** Dynamic filtering engine using `.filter()` and `.every()`.
- **Truth Check:** Boolean validation logic for object collections.

## 🛠 Concepts Applied
- **ES6+ Syntax:** Arrow functions, Destructuring, Template Literals.
- **Functional Programming:** Immutability, Higher-Order Functions.
- **Recursion:** Solving nested problems without iterative loops.
