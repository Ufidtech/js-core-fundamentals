# JavaScript Core Fundamentals & Algorithms

A collection of optimized solutions and mini-projects demonstrating core JavaScript logic, Data Structures, and Algorithms (DSA). 

## 🚀 Purpose
This repository documents my in-depth exploration of JavaScript's intricacies. Rather than just syntax, this collection focuses on **functional programming patterns**, **algorithm efficiency**, and **modern ES6+ standards**.

It serves as a codebase for verifying foundational concepts before scaling up to framework-based development (React/Vue).

## 📂 Key Implementations

### 1. Algorithm Scripting
Solved complex mathematical and string manipulation challenges using efficient logic (Euclidean algorithm, Recursion).
- **Smallest Common Multiple:** computed using GCD/LCM logic and `reduce()`.
- **Caesar Cipher:** Implemented shift ciphers with ASCII manipulation.
- **Palindrome Checker:** String cleaning and two-pointer verification logic.

### 2. Higher Order Functions (HOF)
Demonstrating the power of functional programming to write clean, declarative code.
- Custom implementations using `.map()`, `.filter()`, and `.reduce()` for data processing.
- Currying and Partial Application examples.

## 🛠 Concepts Applied
- **ES6+ Syntax:** Arrow functions, Destructuring, Template Literals.
- **Functional Programming:** Immutability, Pure Functions.
- **Data Structures:** Arrays, Objects, Maps.
